## Beginner

### Front-End

- [Website: FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)
  - Tons of courses to learn HTML, CSS, JS, and React.
  - Completing a course will give you a certificate which can be put on a resume.
- [Website: W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com)
  - Good place for simple demos for HTML, CSS properties, JS, and Bootstrap.
- [Website: LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/)
  - Website focused on challenges and interview question experience. This could be a good place to practice writing code in JavaScript.
- [Website: Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/)
  - Place to look for information on Bootstrap.
- [Video: FreeCodeCamp HTML5 Full Course (2hr)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQN-pnXPaVg)
  - Quick refresher/friendly introduction to HTML.
- [Video: CSS Complete Course (6hr)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Rs2ND1ryYc)
  - Really dense video. I would recommend skipping around to watch the sections about these topics:
    - The general concept of selectors and modifying properties.
    - The box model.
    - CSS grid and flexbox.
- [Video: JavaScript Programming - Full Course (8hr)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS4aFq5-91M)
  - Really beginner-friendly. You can probably skip the parts where he talks about syntax since it is the same as Java and C++.
  - Points to focus on:
    - The DOM and manipulating elements in the HTML document with JS.
    - Variable types and using the console to debug.
    - The course is mainly taught through projects. Try to work ahead and see if you can add additional features and experiment.
- [Video: Bootstrap 5 Crash Course (1.5hr)](https://youtu.be/4sosXZsdy-s)
  - Bootstrap is super popular and is far easier than writing CSS from scratch.
